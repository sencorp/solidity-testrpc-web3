## Instructions
Installation and testing were done in MacOS.
1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc): to install globally, in Terminal, run "npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc". After the installation, run "testrpc", this will generate 10 test accounts pre-funded with 100 ether. 
3. In Terminal, open new window and run "npm init" to initialize the project and create a "package.json" file. 
4. [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/): “npm install web3 —save”. It installs Web3 library and saves it into the "package.json" file.
